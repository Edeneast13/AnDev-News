# AnDev News

AnDev News started as a personal project to make reading Android Weekley news letters easier. I wanted the ability to read articles in an app and bookmark the ones I found most interesting. I have bene using the app for a few years and have decided I would like to add more to it. Possibly add other news sources, etc. 

I have decided to open source the project because I believe that other developers could offer a lot to the project. I do not have as much time to work on this as I would like and feel as a community we could make something really accessible and great.
